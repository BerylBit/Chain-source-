# Introduction

## What is a blockchain, and what is the purpose of it?

#### In simple terms, a blockchain is an exchange of something between two parties without a middleman, but that transaction has been verified and witnessed by others to avoid corruption. The goal is to remove the middleman since he is to be trusted with power in the matter of the exchange.

This simple exchange system has been around for centuries. either in a centralized or decentralized way. Blockchains facilitate exchange by eliminating the need for a middleman and the need for governance or power in your transaction. Sometimes users prefer privacy in their exchanges, which is impossible in the sense of a centralized, middleman exchange.&#x20;

Traditionally, there is always a middleman who controls the data. As an example, Facebook is the middleman between users and advertising companies that buy your data for selling points in good advertising. Another way to look at it is banks between barrows and lenders. Even if Western Union is sending or receiving money, they have the power to collect, stop, or report your money.&#x20;

The issue here is that your data, assets, or ownership are controlled by a central authority (Facebook, banks, government, etc.). Therefore, they have the power to enslave you, control the prices of your assets, or use your own data in terms of privacy. In this scenario, all the power lies with the middleman, and users have to trust and obey to keep them ethical. The blockchain was created to keep decentralized data and reduce trust in any centralized party.

The problem in today's crypto market is that liberals are attempting to remove the true goal of crypto, which is the right to control your own data, to be in a decentralized environment, and to have privacy. This is why BerylBit is here. We are planning to make our network decentralized as much as possible, offering private transactions between two parties, a proof of work algorithm to keep the chain more secure, and working towards developing an UnRug decentralized financial exchange to avoid scammers taking advantage of our network.
